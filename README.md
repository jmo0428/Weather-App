CityWeather is a PWA that uses the MetaWeather API to fetch and display weather information for various cities. The application displays features like a city's weather conditions, low temperature, high temperature, etc. It uses History Mode for Vue Router to ensure clean URLS, and displays information dynamically by passing props to route components. Moreover, the application uses the CORS Anywhere service to bypass CORS restrictions.
